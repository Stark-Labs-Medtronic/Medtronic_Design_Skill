## Structure

Tables are a configurable and customizable component. Designers can pick and
choose certain elements and interactions. The basic table style is the required
base from which tables can be developed. Basic tables are composed of a header
row followed by rows of data below.

| Element | Property | px / rem | Spacing token |

| --- | --- | --- | --- |

| Table header | margin-top | 16 / 1 | $spacing-05 |

|  | margin-bottom | 24 / 1.5 | $spacing-06 |

|  | padding left, padding right | 16 / 1 | $spacing-05 |

| Sort icon | padding | 8 / 0.5 | $spacing-03 |

| Before and after text | padding-left, padding-right | 16 / 1 | $spacing-05 |

Structure and spacing measurements for a basic data table | px/rem

### Columns

Column widths can vary by content and only require a minimum spacing between
columns. Tables require three or more columns.

| Spacing between | Property | px / rem | Spacing token |

| --- | --- | --- | --- |

| Columns | padding | 16 /1 | $spacing-05 |

Structure and spacing measurements for columns in a data table | px/rem

### Rows

Row sizes are customizable. The column header row should always match the row
size of the table. Column header and row text is always centered in the row with
the exception of the extra large which is offset by `padding-top: 16px`. Extra
large row heights are only recommended if your data is expected to have two
lines of content in a single row.

| Size | Height (px / rem) |

| --- | --- |

| Extra small (xs) | 24 / 1.5 |

| Small (sm) | 32 / 2 |

| Medium (md) | 40 / 2.5 |

| Large (lg) | 48 / 3 |

| Extra large (xl) | 64 / 4 |

### Enhancements

After the simple table structure, tables can be enhanced by adding any of the
following: selectable rows, expanding rows, row menus, table batch actions,
overall table menu, and/or table filter.

| Element | Property | px / rem | Spacing token |

| --- | --- | --- | --- |

| Checkbox | height, width | 20 / 1.25 | – |

|  | padding-left, padding-right | 16 / 1 | $spacing-05 |

| Radio button | height, width | 20 / 1.25 | – |

|  | padding-left, padding-right | 16 / 1 | $spacing-05 |

| Overflow menu (sm) | height | 32 / 2 | – |

| Chevron icon | svg | 16 / 1 | – |

|  | click target | 32 / 2 | $spacing-07 |

|  | padding-left, padding-right | 16 / 1 | $spacing-05 |

| Expanded panel | padding-top, padding-right | 16 / 1 | $spacing-05 |

|  | padding-left | 48 / 3 | $spacing-09 |
